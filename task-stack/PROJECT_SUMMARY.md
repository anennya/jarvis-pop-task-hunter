- ✅ Full CRUD operations with slice status updates

## Architecture
```
Next.js App Router
├── Authentication Layer (Basic Auth)
├── UI Pages (/now, /inbox, /login)
├── API Routes (/api/capture, /api/next, /api/action)
├── Breakdown Engine (templates, classifier, breakdown)
└── Data Adapters (mock, sheets, supabase)
```

## Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **URL**: `jarvis-pop-task-hunter.vercel.app`
- **Repository**: `anennya/jarvis-pop-task-hunter`

## Authentication
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `jarvis2024` (change in production)

## Google Sheets Integration
- **Spreadsheet ID**: `1q7N9TfJDqCQ9z3nY2KrgTig0_sAyqNHir1uITiCCo9U`
- **Service Account**: `task-stack-service-account@task-stack-474519.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Tabs**: Tasks, Slices

## Environment Variables
```bash
DATA_BACKEND=sheets
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=jarvis2024
SHEETS_ID=1q7N9TfJDqCQ9z3nY2KrgTig0_sAyqNHir1uITiCCo9U
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={"type":"service_account"...}
```

## Category Templates
1. **Admin** (60min): Setup → Gather Info → Complete Action → Review → Archive
2. **Research – Travel** (90min): Define Scope → Gather Options → Compare → Coordinate → Book → Confirm
3. **Research – Shopping** (60min): Define Needs → Gather Options → Compare Features → Decide → Purchase → Review
4. **Reading/Learning** (45min): Setup → Preview → Read/Watch → Summarize → Apply
5. **Technical Execution** (60min): Setup → Explore → Implement → Test → Refactor → Commit
6. **Quick Chores** (15min): Decide → Take Action → Confirm
7. **Generic** (30min): Clarify → Take Step → Reflect

## Next Steps (Planned)
- [ ] Bulk text import for 50-60 paper tasks
- [ ] Batch review and adjustment interface
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Mobile optimization
